# rust-docs-in-man-pages
A Total Conversion of speedsheet.io's Rust SpeedSheet Into Man Files

## Installation
1. Install the files from the GitHub repository
2. Extract all ".7" files into /usr/local/share/man/man7/ (if the directory doesn't already exist, you can create it yourself)
3. Use either man or wikiman to view the newly installed documentation

## Recommendations
When using this documentation, it is recommended to use Wikiman (https://github.com/filiparag/wikiman) to view the documentation contents, as you can just search "Rust", "Rustup", "Cargo", or any of the section titles to be taken to said sections without having to memorize the whole title, whilst also providing a user-friendly overview of all man files on your system (including this documentation!).
